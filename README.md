# Agentic-Google-Calendar-Assistant-using-n8n
This project demonstrates an agentic AI workflow built using n8n that understands natural language chat messages and autonomously creates events in Google Calendar.  The agent extracts event details such as date, time, and description from conversational input and executes the appropriate action without requiring structured commands from the user.
